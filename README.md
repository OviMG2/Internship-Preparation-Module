# Internship-Preparation-Module

Objective:
To build a practical system for collecting, processing, and visualizing real-time environmental data using IoT technologies and automation tools.

Description:
During this project, I created a system that monitors temperature and air pollution in Bucharest. Data was collected using an API, processed with Node-RED, and visualized on Grafana dashboards. The system also featured notifications sent via email and Telegram when specific thresholds were exceeded.

I set up an MQTT broker to handle real-time data transmission and used InfluxDB as the database for storing the collected data. Additionally, I experimented with blockchain technology, implementing smart contracts that could trigger automated actions based on specific conditions, such as high temperatures.

Key Technologies:
	•	Programming: Python, JavaScript
	•	Tools: Grafana, Node-RED, Docker, Telegram API
	•	Protocols: MQTT
	•	Database: InfluxDB

Impact:
This project helped me gain hands-on experience in IoT, real-time data processing, and system integration, while exploring advanced tools like blockchain and containerization for practical applications.
