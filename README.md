# Internship-Preparation-Module

Overview:
During the pre-practice program, I developed an IoT-based system integrating multiple technologies to monitor and visualize environmental data in real time. The project focused on collecting temperature and air pollution data for Bucharest, processing it, and presenting actionable insights using modern tools like Grafana, Node-RED, and blockchain.

Key Activities:
	1.	IoT and MQTT Integration:
	•	Configured an MQTT broker to publish temperature and air pollution data using an API from OpenWeatherMap.
	•	Enabled bi-directional communication for real-time data updates.
	2.	Node-RED Development:
	•	Utilized Node-RED for flow-based data processing.
	•	Created a pipeline for data retrieval, processing, and publishing back to the MQTT broker.
	3.	Data Visualization in Grafana:
	•	Connected Grafana to InfluxDB to visualize real-time environmental metrics.
	•	Set up alert systems to notify users when specific conditions were met via email.
	4.	Telegram Chatbot Implementation:
	•	Developed a chatbot to query environmental data and provide instant updates.
	•	Used Python for bot commands and API integration.
	5.	Blockchain Application:
	•	Experimented with smart contracts on a test blockchain platform to automate actions based on data thresholds.
	6.	Dockerized Deployment:
	•	Created a Docker image for deploying an ArrowHead-based component.
	•	Used containerization to ensure consistency across different environments.

Technologies Used:
	•	Programming Languages: Python, JavaScript.
	•	Tools: Node-RED, Grafana, Telegram API, Docker.
	•	Protocols: MQTT.
	•	Databases: InfluxDB.
	•	Blockchain Platform: MultiversX Testnet.

Impact:
The project demonstrated the potential of integrating IoT, real-time data visualization, and automation technologies to solve environmental monitoring challenges efficiently. It also provided valuable insights into cross-platform tool integration and scalability.
